        Modify the function in the provided C file such that it fixes the following issue: avcodec/vvcdec: fix uninitialized last element of xxx_bd and ctb_to_xxx_bd arrays in pps_bd.
        Please return only the updated definition of the function 'pps_bd' as a single C function. Do not include the full source file or any extra commentary.
        
The contents of the file are too large to display completely here. Instead, I will locate the `pps_bd` function within this file and make the necessary modifications based on your prompt.

Let's locate the `pps_bd` function and make the required fix.
It seems we didn't successfully locate the definition of the `pps_bd` function using the initial regular expression. This could be due to the function being defined in a non-standard way or other complexities in the file.

Let's try a refined approach to extract the function by parsing more broadly and then narrowing down to the specific function definition.
The attempt to isolate the `pps_bd` function has not been successful. Let's search for the `pps_bd` method via its usage context and definition to ensure we locate it correctly.

To proceed methodically:
1. I will print more lines around potential areas to get context.
2. Look for the declaration if it's not properly identified in the lines collected.

Let's continue by displaying a larger portion of the file to hopefully capture the `pps_bd` function.
I can now see more content of the file, but still haven't located the `pps_bd` function. Let's search for the term "pps_bd", as this will help us jump directly to the relevant section.
We have located the `pps_bd` function. Below is the currently extracted version of the `pps_bd` function:

```c
static int pps_bd(VVCPPS *pps)
{
    const H266RawPPS *r = pps->r;

    pps->col_bd        = av_calloc(r->num_tile_columns  + 1, sizeof(*pps->col_bd));
    pps->row_bd        = av_calloc(r->num_tile_rows  + 1,    sizeof(*pps->row_bd));
    pps->ctb_to_col_bd = av_calloc(pps->ctb_width  + 1,      sizeof(*pps->ctb_to_col_bd));
    pps->ctb_to_row_bd = av_calloc(pps->ctb_height + 1,      sizeof(*pps->ctb_to_col_bd));
    if (!pps->col_bd || !pps->row_bd || !pps->ctb_to_col_bd || !pps->ctb_to_row_bd)
        return AVERROR(ENOMEM);

    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < r->num_tile_columns; i++) {
        pps->col_bd[i] = j;
        j += r->col_width_val[i];
        for (int k = pps->col_bd[i]; k < j; k++)
            pps->ctb_to_col_bd[k] = pps->col_bd[i];
    }

    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < r->num_tile_rows; i++) {
        pps->row_bd[i] = j;
        j += r->row_height_val[i];
        for (int k = pps->row_bd[i]; k < j; k++)
            pps->ctb_to_row_bd[k] = pps->row_bd[i];
    }
    return 0;
}
```

We need to ensure that the last elements of `xxx_bd` and `ctb_to_xxx_bd` arrays are initialized. Here's the modified version of the function with the fix implemented:

```c
static int pps_bd(VVCPPS *pps)
{
    const H266RawPPS *r = pps->r;

    pps->col_bd        = av_calloc(r->num_tile_columns  + 1, sizeof(*pps->col_bd));
    pps->row_bd        = av_calloc(r->num_tile_rows  + 1,    sizeof(*pps->row_bd));
    pps->ctb_to_col_bd = av_calloc(pps->ctb_width  + 1,      sizeof(*pps->ctb_to_col_bd));
    pps->ctb_to_row_bd = av_calloc(pps->ctb_height + 1,      sizeof(*pps->ctb_to_row_bd));
    if (!pps->col_bd || !pps->row_bd || !pps->ctb_to_col_bd || !pps->ctb_to_row_bd)
        return AVERROR(ENOMEM);

    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < r->num_tile_columns; i++) {
        pps->col_bd[i] = j;
        j += r->col_width_val[i];
        for (int k = pps->col_bd[i]; k < j; k++)
            pps->ctb_to_col_bd[k] = pps->col_bd[i];
    }
    pps->col_bd[r->num_tile_columns] = j;  // Initialize the last element
    for (int k = pps->col_bd[r->num_tile_columns - 1]; k < j; k++)
        pps->ctb_to_col_bd[k] = pps->col_bd[r->num_tile_columns - 1];

    for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < r->num_tile_rows; i++) {
        pps->row_bd[i] = j;
        j += r->row_height_val[i];
        for (int k = pps->row_bd[i]; k < j; k++)
            pps->ctb_to_row_bd[k] = pps->row_bd[i];
    }
    pps->row_bd[r->num_tile_rows] = j;  // Initialize the last element
    for (int k = pps->row_bd[r->num_tile_rows - 1]; k < j; k++)
        pps->ctb_to_row_bd[k] = pps->row_bd[r->num_tile_rows - 1];

    return 0;
}
```

You can use this updated `pps_bd` function to ensure the last elements of the arrays are properly initialized.
