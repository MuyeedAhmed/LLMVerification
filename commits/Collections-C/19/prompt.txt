Modify the function in the provided old.c such that it fixes the following issue: 
the functions tree_min and tree_max try to go through the treetable from the given node until finding a sentinel. 
However, when the function receives a sentinel, It will try to go to its children, which have been allocated with calloc to 0. 
As the children do not correspond to the sentinel, they will try to be dereferenced, causing a segfault. in 
static INLINE RBNode *tree_min(CC_TreeTable const * const table, RBNode *n)
static INLINE RBNode *tree_max(CC_TreeTable const * const table, RBNode *n)
