Implement a function in old.c: enum cc_stat stack_filter(Stack *stack, bool (*predicate)(const void *), Stack **out)
such that it 
Filters the Stack by creating a new Stack that contains all elements from the
original Stack that return true on pred(element) without modifying the original
Stack.
@param[in] stack   Stack that is to be filtered
@param[in] predicate predicate function which returns true if the element should
                 be kept in the filtered stack
@param[out] out pointer to where the new filtered Stack is to be stored
@return CC_OK if the Stack was filtered successfully, CC_ERR_OUT_OF_RANGE
if the Stack is empty, or CC_ERR_ALLOC if the memory allocation for the
new Stack failed.
