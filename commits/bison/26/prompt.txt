Actual prompt:
Modify the function in the provided old.c: bool ielr_item_has_lookahead (state *s, symbol_number lhs, size_t item, symbol_number lookahead, state ***predecessors, bitset **item_lookahead_sets), such that it Don't rely on the item index to check whether is_successor_of_initial_item. It is certainly more costly than just checking the item index, but (i) we need to compute the rule anyway, so it's not very much more costly, and (ii) in ielr_item_has_lookahead, this situation is actually impossible, so an optimizing compiler reading the assertions should actually avoid this computation.. Provide only the functional implementation. Do not include any explaination or use case.
